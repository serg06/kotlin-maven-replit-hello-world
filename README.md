## Hello World with Kotlin and Maven, works on Replit

Updated for 2022.

Based off of the Kotlin template on Replit (OpenJDK 16).

It seems that Replit's nix support is completely busted, so if you want to use this project, you need to create a Replit from the Kotlin template and copy these files over there manually.
